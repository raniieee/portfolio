                <h3>Project 1: LOOPS</h3>
                <img src="images\loops.jpg" alt="Placeholder image for Project 1">
                <p>
                    The Python script displayed in the image calculates the sum of all even numbers up to a limit
                    defined by the user's input, n. The program first initializes an accumulator variable, sum_even,
                    to zero and prompts the user to enter a number, which is stored in n. The core of the program is a
                    for loop that utilizes the range(2, n + 1, 2) function. This construction is highly efficient
                    because it starts the sequence at 2 (the first positive even number), includes n if it is even by
                    setting the stop value to n + 1, and most importantly, uses a step of 2 to only iterate over even
                    numbers. Inside the loop, the current even number i is added to the running total (sum_even =
                    sum_even + i). As shown in the terminal output, when the user inputs 23 for n, the program
                    calculates the sum of 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 22 and outputs the final result, 132. This script
                    effectively demonstrates the use of the range function with a step argument for conditional
                    summation within a specific range.

                <h3>Project 2: Mini Machine </h3>
                <img src="images\mini machine.jpg" alt="Placeholder image for Project 2">
                <p>
                    This is a mini machine, specifically, a Command Line Interface (CLI) application designed to
                    simulate
                    a basic cafe or coffee shop ordering system.</p>

                <li>
                    Key Features:</li>
                <li>Menu Display: It presents a short, numbered menu with items (Coffee, Latte, Muffin, Bagel) and their
                    corresponding prices.</li>

                <li>User Input/Interaction: The user interacts by typing in the number corresponding to the item they
                    wish to order.</li>

                <li>Order Building: The program tracks the items added to the customer's order dynamically (e.g., ->
                    Added Muffin (Chocolate) to your order.).</li>

                <li>Exit/Calculation: The user enters '9' to signal the end of the order and calculate the total.</li>

                <h3>Project 3: 3d Image</h3>
                <img src="images\3d image.jpg" alt="Placeholder image for Project 3">
                <p>
                    The 3d image displays a graphical representation of a 3D windmill, complete with rotating blades and
                    a
                    simulated reflection, generated in a specialized plotting environment. The model features a central
                    brown cylindrical tower, topped by a black disc representing the nacelle or hub. Attached to the hub
                    are two prominent blue blades, angled to suggest motion and energy generation. The visualization is
                    rendered within a 3D Cartesian coordinate system, clearly labeled with X, Y, and Z axes, which helps
                    to orient the object in space. A notable feature is the semi-transparent reflection of the structure
                    and the blades on the ground plane (Z=0), which enhances the depth and realism of the
                    three-dimensional scene. This plot is an excellent example of using computational tools, such as
                    Matplotlib's 3D capabilities, to visualize and simulate mechanical structures and engineering
                    concepts like wind turbines.
